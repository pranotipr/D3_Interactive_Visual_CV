=>Design and Implementation of Platform for Social Media Analytics (Deep Learning)  

      <b>C-DOT, Bangalore, India â€“ Research & Development Engineer		      Aug 2013 - Jul 2016</b>
<i><b>Project: Smart Network Management System for LTE telecommunication network</b></i>
		  
=>Mobility Load Balancing: Designed and implemented Mobility load Balancing (MLB) Algorithm that
facilitates automatic load distribution at the Evolved Node B (ENodeB)- radio access nodes for 
4G LTE Network.

=>Machine learning based Network Management: Developed a machine learning based scheme that uses
Artificial Neural Network and case based reasoning for efficient fault detection.

<i><b>Project: Application Software Development for GSM Radio Access Network Management System</b></i>
		  
=>Network Visualization: As a part of Network Management System (NMS), implemented feature for 
providing high-resolution visualization of network health report (a large corpus) using the 
self-organizing map (SOM) method. Worked on unsupervised, competitive-learning based scheme 
that provides experts with a map that is visually engaging and conceptually stimulating for 
purpose of better network health monitoring

=>Designed and developed modules for System Management, Fault Tolerance and Statistics Collection

=>Designed Active Passive Redundancy Structure to facilitate High Availability at the BSC (Base 
Station Controller) module. 

=>As a part of Dynamic Software Upgrade feature, developed software for providing rolling upgrade 
of  system services.

=>Honored by Spot Award for taking up initiative to develop test-automation framework using Unix 
utilities.
